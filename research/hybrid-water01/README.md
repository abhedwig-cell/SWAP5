# HYBRID-WATER01 donor day boundary

Experimental proof on canonical base `7535a9e650aa01ca3ee711353c2e2801e2872f00`.
PR #1618 has a complete corrected V9 run and exact own-year replay. This
experiment uses the original sharp B0 donor and the unmodified Andelst inputs.

Run from the repository root with GNU Fortran 13.3.0:

```sh
python tools/vq/b0_source_runner.py --archive /path/to/SWAP_4.3.1.zip \
  --work-dir /tmp/hybrid-b0 --case 3.macroporeflow
python research/hybrid-water01/run_day_return.py \
  --archive /path/to/SWAP_4.3.1.zip --reference-work /tmp/hybrid-b0 \
  --output /tmp/hybrid-day-return
```

The second command relinks three build-local donors: the loop return, a
four-call driver, and read-only full-precision stock/flux output. The solver
providers, original step selection and day-end process order come from B0.
All four windows completed and the standard daily series is exact against
the frozen B0 prefix. The largest independent recomputation of the donor's
reported daily water inventory residual is about 5.97e-7 cm. This is the
legacy ledger, with its own interception and snow conventions, not a new
SWAP5 kernel mass certificate.

The day-return test keeps one live donor process. In particular, the module
state and the local SAVE fields still live in the executable. A successful
return provides no fresh-process restart or A/B isolation proof. The next
implementation boundary is an explicit per-instance capture/restore of
continuation and attempt state, including TimeControl's saved clock,
HeadCalc's retained memory, BoundTop's atmospheric state, macro event
history, the crop and thermal continuations, and meteorological and output
cursors. The external Cauchy head, kernel rollback and SWAP5-owned commit
are also open. No canonical model or test gate has been altered.
