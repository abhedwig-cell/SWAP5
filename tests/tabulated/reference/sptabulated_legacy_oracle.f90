!               TSPACK:  Tension Spline Curve Fitting Package

!       I.  INTRODUCTION
!
!
!            The primary purpose of TSPACK is to construct a smooth
!       function which interpolates a discrete set of data points.
!       The function may be required to have either one or two con-
!       tinuous derivatives, and, in the C-2 case, several options
!       are provided for selecting end conditions.  If the accuracy
!       of the data does not warrant interpolation, a smoothing func-
!       tion (which does not pass through the data points) may be
!       constructed instead.  The fitting method is designed to avoid
!       extraneous inflection points (associated with rapidly varying
!       data values) and preserve local shape properties of the data
!       (monotonicity and convexity), or to satisfy the more general
!       constraints of bounds on function values or first derivatives.
!       The package also provides a parametric representation for con-
!       structing general planar curves and space curves.
!
!            The fitting function h(x) (or each component h(t) in the
!       case of a parametric curve) is defined locally, on each
!       interval associated with a pair of adjacent abscissae (knots),
!       by its values and first derivatives at the endpoints of the
!       interval, along with a nonnegative tension factor SIGMA
!       associated with the interval (h is a Hermite interpolatory
!       tension spline).  With SIGMA = 0, h is the cubic function
!       defined by the endpoint values and derivatives, and, as SIGMA
!       increases, h approaches the linear interpolant of the endpoint
!       values.  Since the linear interpolant preserves positivity,
!       monotonicity, and convexity of the data, h can be forced to
!       preserve these properties by choosing SIGMA sufficiently
!       large.  Also, since SIGMA varies with intervals, no more
!       tension than necessary is used in each interval, resulting in
!       a better fit and greater efficiency than is achieved with a
!       single constant tension factor.
!
!
!
!       II.  USAGE
!
!
!            TSPACK must be linked to a driver program which re-
!       serves storage, reads a data set, and calls the appropriate
!       subprograms selected from those described below in section
!       III.B.  Header comments in the software modules provide
!       details regarding the specification of input parameters and
!       the work space requirements.  It is recommended that curves
!       be plotted in order to assess their appropriateness for the
!       application.  This requires a user-supplied graphics package.
!
!
!
!       III.  SOFTWARE
!
!
!       A)  Code
!
!            The code is written in 1977 ANSI Standard Fortran.  All
!       variable and array names conform to the default typing con-
!       vention:  I-N for type INTEGER and A-H or O-Z for type REAL.
!       (There are no DOUBLE PRECISION variables.)  There are 32
!       modules, and they are ordered alphabetically in the package.
!       Each consists of the following sections:
!
!           1)  the module name and parameter list with spaces sepa-
!               rating the parameters into one to three subsets:
!               input parameters, I/O parameters, and output parame-
!               ters (in that order);
!           2)  type statements in which all parameters are typed
!               and arrays are dimensioned;
!           3)  a heading with the name of the package, identifica-
!               tion of the author, and date of the most recent
!               modification to the module;
!           4)  a description of the module's purpose and other rel-
!               evant information for the user;
!           5)  input parameter descriptions and output parameter
!               descriptions in the same order as the parameter
!               list;
!           6)  a list of other modules required (called either
!               directly or indirectly);
!           7)  a list of intrinsic functions called, if any; and
!           8)  the code, including comments.
!
!            Note that it is assumed that floating point underflow
!       results in assignment of the value zero.  If not the default,
!       this may be specified as either a compiler option or an
!       operating system option.  Also, overflow is avoided by re-
!       stricting arguments to the exponential function EXP to have
!       value at most SBIG=85.  SBIG, which appears in DATA statements
!       in the evaluation functions, HVAL, HPVAL, HPPVAL, and TSINTL,
!       must be decreased if it is necessary to accomodate a floating
!       point number system with fewer than 8 bits in the exponent.
!       No other system dependencies are present in the code.
!
!            The modules that solve nonlinear equations, SIGS, SIGBP,
!       SIG0, SIG1, SIG2, and SMCRV, include diagnostic print capabi-
!       lity which allows the iteration to be traced.  This can be
!       enabled by altering logical unit number LUN in a DATA state-
!       ment in the relevant module.
!
!
!       B)  Module Descriptions
!
!            The software modules are divided into three categories,
!       referred to as level 1, level 2, and level 3, corresponding
!       to the hierarchy of calling sequences:  level 1 modules call
!       level 2 modules which call level 3 modules.  For most ap-
!       plications, the driver need only call two level 1 modules --
!       one from each of groups (a) and (b).  However, additional
!       control over various options can be obtained by directly
!       calling level 2 modules.  Also, additional fitting methods,
!       such as parametric smoothing, can be obtained by calling
!       level 2 modules.  Note that, in the case of smoothing or C-2
!       interpolation with automatically selected tension, the use
!       of level 2 modules requires that an iteration be placed around
!       the computation of knot derivatives and tension factors.
!
!
!
!       1) Level 1 modules
!
!            These are divided into two groups.
!
!       a)  The following modules return knots (in the parametric
!           case), knot derivatives, tension factors, and, in the
!           case of smoothing, knot function values, which define
!           the fitting function (or functions in the parametric
!           case).  The naming convention should be evident from the
!           descriptions.
!
!
!       TSPSI   Subroutine which constructs a shape-preserving or
!                 unconstrained interpolatory function.  Refer to
!                 TSVAL1.
!
!       TSPSS   Subroutine which constructs a shape-preserving or
!                 unconstrained smoothing spline.  Refer to TSVAL1.
!
!       TSPSP   Subroutine which constructs a shape-preserving or
!                 unconstrained planar curve or space curve.  Refer
!                 to TSVAL2 and TSVAL3.
!
!       TSPBI   Subroutine which constructs a bounds-constrained
!                 interpolatory function.  The constraints are defined
!                 by a user-supplied array containing upper and lower
!                 bounds on function values and first derivatives,
!                 along with required signs for the second derivative,
!                 for each interval.  Refer to TSVAL1.
!
!       TSPBP   Subroutine which constructs a bounds-constrained
!                 parametric planar curve.  The constraints are de-
!                 fined by user-supplied arrays containing upper and
!                 lower bounds on the signed perpendicular distance
!                 between the smooth curve segment and the polygonal
!                 line segment associated with each knot interval.
!                 The bounds might, for example, be chosen to avoid
!                 intersections between smooth contour curves.  Refer
!                 to TSVAL2.
!
!
!       b)  The following modules return values, derivatives, or
!           integrals of the fitting function(s).
!
!
!       TSVAL1  Subroutine which evaluates a Hermite interpolatory
!                 tension spline or its first or second derivative at
!                 a user-specified set of points.  Note that a smooth-
!                 ing curve constructed by TSPSS is the interpolant of
!                 the computed knot function values.  The evaluation
!                 points need not lie in the interval defined by the
!                 knots, but care must be exercised in assessing the
!                 accuracy of extrapolation.
!
!       TSVAL2  Subroutine which returns values or derivatives of a
!                 pair of Hermite interpolatory tension splines which
!                 form the components of a parametric planar curve.
!                 The output values may be used to construct unit tan-
!                 gent vectors, curvature vectors, etc.
!
!       TSVAL3  Subroutine which returns values or derivatives of
!                 three Hermite interpolatory tension splines which
!                 form the components of a parametric space curve.
!
!       TSINTL  Function which returns the integral over a specified
!                 domain of a Hermite interpolatory tension spline.
!                 This provides an effective means of quadrature for
!                 a function defined only by a discrete set of values.
!
!
!
!       2) Level 2 modules
!
!            These are divided into four groups.
!
!       a)  The following modules are called by TSPSP and TSPBP to
!           obtain a sequence of knots (parameter values) associated
!           with a parametric curve.  For some data sets, it might
!           be advantageous to replace these with routines that
!           implement an alternative method of parameterization.
!
!
!       ARCL2D  Subroutine which computes the sequence of cumulative
!                 arc lengths associated with a sequence of points in
!                 the plane.
!
!       ARCL3D  Subroutine which computes the sequence of cumulative
!                 arc lengths associated with a sequence of points in
!                 3-space.
!
!
!       b)  The following modules are called by the level 1, group (a)
!           modules to obtain knot derivatives (and values in the case
!           of SMCRV).
!
!
!    YPC1       Subroutine which employs a monotonicity-constrained
!                quadratic interpolation method to compute locally
!                defined derivative estimates, resulting in a C-1
!                fit.
!
!       YPC1P    Subroutine similar to YPC1 for the case of periodic
!                 end conditions.  In the case of a parametric curve
!                 fit, periodic end conditions are necessary to ob-
!                 tain a closed curve.
!
!       YPC2     Subroutine which determines a set of knot-derivative
!                 estimates which result in a tension spline with two
!                 continuous derivatives and satisfying specified
!                 end conditions.
!
!       YPC2P    Subroutine similar to YPC2 for the case of periodic
!                 end conditions.
!
!       SMCRV    Subroutine which, given a sequence of abscissae with
!                 associated data values and tension factors, returns
!                 a set of function values and first derivative values
!                 defining a twice-continuously differentiable tension
!                spline which smoothes the data and satisfies either
!                natural or periodic end conditions.
!
!
!       c)  The following modules are called by the level 1, group (a)
!           modules to obtain tension factors associated with knot
!           intervals.
!
!
!       SIGS    Subroutine which, given a sequence of abscissae,
!                 function values, and first derivative values,
!                 determines the set of minimum tension factors for
!                 which the Hermite interpolatory tension spline
!                 preserves local shape properties (monotonicity
!                 and convexity) of the data.  SIGS is called by
!                 TSPSI, TSPSS, and TSPSP.
!
!       SIGBI   Subroutine which, given a sequence of abscissae,
!                 function values, and first derivative values,
!                 determines the set of minimum tension factors for
!                 which the Hermite interpolatory tension spline
!                 satisfies specified bounds constraints.  SIGBI is
!                 called by TSPBI.
!
!       SIGBP   Subroutine which, given a sequence of points in the
!                 plane with associated derivative vectors, determines
!                 the set of minimum tension factors for which the
!                 parametric planar tension spline curve defined by
!                 the data satisfies specified bounds on the signed
!                 orthogonal distance between the parametric curve and
!                 the polygonal curve defined by the points.  SIGBP is
!                 called by TSPBP.
!
!
!       d)  The following functions are called by the level 1, group
!           (b) modules to obtain values and derivatives.  These pro-
!           vide a more convenient alternative to the level 1 routines
!           when a single value is needed.
!
!
!       HVAL     Function which evaluates a Hermite interpolatory ten-
!                 sion spline at a specified point.
!
!       HPVAL    Function which evaluates the first derivative of a
!                 Hermite interpolatory tension spline at a specified
!                 point.
!
!       HPPVAL  Function which evaluates the second derivative of a
!                 Hermite interpolatory tension spline at a specified
!                 point.
!
!
!
!       3) Level 3 modules
!
!            These are divided into three groups.
!
!       a)  The following functions are called by SIGBI to compute
!           tension factors, and are convenient for obtaining an
!           optimal tension factor associated with a single interval.
!
!
!       SIG0     Function which, given a pair of abscissae, along with
!                 associated endpoint values and derivatives, deter-
!                 mines the smallest tension factor for which the
!                 corresponding Hermite interpolatory tension spline
!                 satisfies a specified bound on function values in
!                 the interval.
!
!       SIG1     Function which, given a pair of abscissae, along with
!                 associated endpoint data, determines the smallest
!                 tension factor for which the corresponding Hermite
!                 interpolatory tension spline satisfies a specified
!                 bound on first derivative values in the interval.
!
!       SIG2     Function which, given a pair of abscissae, along with
!                 associated endpoint data, determines the smallest
!                 tension factor for which the corresponding Hermite
!                 interpolatory tension spline preserves convexity
!                 (or concavity) of the data.
!
!
!       b)  The following modules are of general utility.
!
!
!       INTRVL Function which, given an increasing sequence of ab-
!                 scissae, returns the index of an interval containing
!                a specified point.  INTRVL is called by the evalua-
!                tion functions TSINTL, HVAL, HPVAL, and HPPVAL.
!
!       SNHCSH  Subroutine called by several modules to compute
!                 accurate approximations to the modified hyperbolic
!                 functions which form a basis for exponential ten-
!                 sion splines.
!
!       STORE   Function used by SIGBP, SIGS, SIG0, SIG1, and SIG2 in

!C   Given data values associated with a strictly increasing
!C or decreasing sequence of three abscissae X1, X2, and X3,
!C this function returns a derivative estimate at X1 based on
!C the tension spline H(x) which interpolates the data points
!C and has third derivative equal to zero at X1.  Letting S1
!C denote the slope defined by the first two points, the est-
!C mate is obtained by constraining the derivative of H at X1
!C so that it has the same sign as S1 and its magnitude is
!C at most 3*abs(S1).  If SIGMA = 0, H(x) is quadratic and
!C the derivative estimate is identical to the value computed
!C by Subroutine YPC1 at the first point (or the last point
!C if the abscissae are decreasing).
!C
!C On input:
!C

!C                  or X1 > X2 > X3.

!C   This function evaluates a Hermite interpolatory tension
!C spline H at a point T.  Note that a large value of SIGMA
!C may cause underflow.  The result is assumed to be zero.

!C   Given a pair of abscissae with associated ordinates and
!C slopes, this function determines the smallest (nonnega-

!C of the Hermite interpolatory tension spline H(x), defined
!C by SIGMA and the data, is bounded (either above or below)
!C by HPBND for all x in (X1,X2).
!C
!C On input:
!C
!C       X1,X2 = Abscissae.  X1 < X2.
!C

!C             IFL = 1 if HPBND is an upper bound on HP.

!C       TOL = Tolerance whose magnitude determines how close

!C             finite tension is necessary and sufficient to
!C             satisfy the constraint.  For a lower bound,
!C             SIGMA is chosen so that HPBND .LE. HPMIN .LE.
!C             HPBND + abs(TOL), where HPMIN is the minimum

!C             abs(TOL) .LE. HPMAX .LE. HPBND.  Thus, the
!C             constraint is satisfied but possibly with more
!C             tension than necessary.

!C       IER = Error indicator:

!C             IER = 1 if no errors were encountered but in-
!C                     finite tension is required to satisfy
!C                     the constraint (e.g., IFL = -1, HPBND
!C                     = S, and Y1P > S).
!C             IER = -1 if X2 .LE. X1 or abs(IFL) .NE. 1.

!C
!C       SIG1 = Minimum tension factor defined above unless
!C              IER < 0, in which case SIG1 = -1.  If IER =

!C              to the linear interpolant of the endpoint

!C
!C   SIGBI may be used in conjunction with Subroutine YPC2
!C (or YPC2P) in order to produce a !C-2 interpolant which
!C satisfies the constraints.  This is achieved by calling
!C YPC2 with SIGMA initialized to the zero vector, and then
!C alternating calls to SIGBI with calls to YPC2 until the
!C change in SIGMA is small (refer to the parameter descrip-
!C tions for SIGMA, DSMAX and IER), or the maximum relative
!C change in YP is bounded by a tolerance (a reasonable value
!C is .01).  A similar procedure may be used to produce a !C-2

!C               for all I (unless the input value is larger).
!C               The factors are as small as possible (within

!C               input values.  If infinite tension is re-
!C               quired in interval (X(I),X(I+1)), then
!C               SIGMA(I) = 85 (and H is an approximation to
!C               the linear interpolant on the interval),

!C               and only if constraint K cannot be satis-
!C               fied.  Thus, all constraints in interval I

!C           ated with interval (X(I),X(I+1)) as follows:
!C
!C             B(1,I) is an upper bound on H
!C             B(2,I) is a lower bound on H
!C             B(3,I) is an upper bound on HP
!C             B(4,I) is a lower bound on HP
!C             B(5,I) specifies the required sign of HPP
!C
!C           where HP and HPP denote the first and second
!C           derivatives of H, respectively.  A null con-
!C           straint is specified by abs(B(K,I)) .GE. BMAX
!C           for K < 5, or B(5,I) = 0:   B(1,I) .GE. BMAX,
!C           B(2,I) .LE. -BMAX, B(3,I) .GE. BMAX, B(4,I) .LE.
!C           -BMAX, or B(5,I) = 0.  Any positive value of
!C           B(5,I) specifies that H should be convex, a
!C           negative values specifies that H should be con-
!C           cave, and 0 specifies that no restriction be
!C           placed on HPP.  Refer to Functions SIG0, SIG1,
!C           and SIG2 for definitions of valid constraints.
!C
!C       BMAX = User-defined value of infinity which, when
!C              used as an upper bound in B (or when when
!C              its negative is used as a lower bound),
!C              specifies that no constraint is to be en-
!C              forced.

!C       LWK = Length of work space WK:

!C            no error other than invalid constraints was
!C            encountered):
!C            WK(1) = Maximum relative change in a component
!C                    of YP on the last iteration.
!C            WK(2) = Maximum relative change in a component
!C                    of SIGMA on the last iteration.
!C
!C       YP = Array containing derivatives of H at the
!C            abscissae.  YP is not altered if -3 < IER < 0,
!C            and YP is only partially defined if IER = -4.
!C
!C       SIGMA = Array containing tension factors for which
!C               H(x) satisfies the constraints defined by B.
!C               SIGMA(I) is associated with interval (X(I),
!C               X(I+1)) for I = 1,...,N-1.  If infinite ten-
!C               sion is required in interval I, then
!C               SIGMA(I) = 85 (and H is an approximation to
!C               the linear interpolant on the interval),
!C               and if no constraint is specified in the
!C               interval, then SIGMA(I) = 0, and thus H is
!C               cubic.  Invalid constraints are treated as
!C               null constraints.  SIGMA is not altered if
!C               -3 < IER < 0 (unless IENDC is invalid), and
!C               SIGMA is the zero vector if IER = -4 or
!C               IENDC (if used) is invalid.
!C
!C       ICFLG = Array of invalid constraint flags associated
!C               with intervals.  For I = 1 to N-1, ICFLG(I)
!C               is a 5-bit value b5b4b3b2b1, where bK = 1 if
!C               and only if constraint K cannot be satis-
!C               fied.  Thus, all constraints in interval I
!C               are satisfied if and only if ICFLG(I) = 0
!C               (and IER .GE. 0).  ICFLG is not altered if
!C               IER < 0.
!C
!C       IER = Error indicator or iteration count:
!C             IER = IC .GE. 0 if no errors were encountered
!C                      (other than invalid constraints) and

!C                      YPC1, YPC1P, YPC2 or YPC2P were
!C                      employed.  (IC = 0 if NCD = 1).
!C             IER = -1 if N, NCD, or IENDC is outside its
!C                      valid range.
!C             IER = -2 if LWK is too small.

!C   This subroutine employs a three-point quadratic interpo-
!C lation method to compute local derivative estimates YP
!C associated with a set of data points.  The interpolation
!C formula is the monotonicity-constrained parabolic method
!C described in the reference cited below.  A Hermite int-
!C erpolant of the data values and derivative estimates pre-
!C serves monotonicity of the data.  Linear interpolation is
!C used if N = 2.  The method is invariant under a linear
!C scaling of the coordinates but is not additive.

!C   This subroutine solves a linear system for a set of
!C first derivatives YP associated with a Hermite interpola-
!C tory tension spline H(x).  The derivatives are chosen so
!C that H(x) has two continuous derivatives for all x, and H
!C satisfies periodic end conditions:  first and second der-
!C ivatives of H at X(1) agree with those at X(N), and thus

!C   This function evaluates a Hermite interpolatory tension
!C spline H at a point T.  Note that a large value of SIGMA
!C may cause underflow.  The result is assumed to be zero.
!C
!C   Given arrays X, Y, YP, and SIGMA of length NN, if T is
!C known to lie in the interval (X(I),X(J)) for some I < J,
!C a gain in efficiency can be achieved by calling this
!C function with N = J+1-I (rather than NN) and the I-th
!C components of the arrays (rather than the first) as par-
!C ameters.
!C
!C On input:
!C
!C       T = Point at which H is to be evaluated.  Extrapo-
!C           lation is performed if T < X(1) or T > X(N).
!C
!C       N = Number of data points.  N .GE. 2.
!C
!C       X = Array of length N containing the abscissae.
!C           These must be in strictly increasing order:
!C           X(I) < X(I+1) for I = 1,...,N-1.
!C
!C       Y = Array of length N containing data values.
!C           H(X(I)) = Y(I) for I = 1,...,N.
!C
!C       YP = Array of length N containing first deriva-
!C            tives.  HP(X(I)) = YP(I) for I = 1,...,N, where
!C            HP denotes the derivative of H.
!C
!C       SIGMA = Array of length N-1 containing tension fac-
!C               tors whose absolute values determine the
!C               balance between cubic and linear in each
!C               interval.  SIGMA(I) is associated with int-
!C               erval (I,I+1) for I = 1,...,N-1.
!C
!C Input parameters are not altered by this function.
!C
!C On output:
!C
!C       IER = Error indicator:
!C             IER = 0  if no errors were encountered and
!C                      X(1) .LE. T .LE. X(N).
!C             IER = 1  if no errors were encountered and
!C                      extrapolation was necessary.
!C             IER = -1 if N < 2.
!C             IER = -2 if the abscissae are not in strictly
!C                      increasing order.  (This error will
!C                      not necessarily be detected.)

!C       HVAL = Function value H(T), or zero if IER < 0.

!C***DESCRIPTION
!C
!C         DPCHIC:  Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolation Coefficients.
!C
!C     Sets derivatives needed to determine a piecewise monotone piece-
!C     wise cubic interpolant to the data given in X and F satisfying the
!C     boundary conditions specified by IC and VC.
!C
!C     The treatment of points where monotonicity switches direction is
!C     controlled by argument SWITCH.
!C
!C     To facilitate two-dimensional applications, includes an increment
!C     between successive values of the F- and D-arrays.
!C
!C     The resulting piecewise cubic Hermite function may be evaluated
!C     by DPCHFE or DPCHFD.

!C
!C        CALL DPCHIC (IC, VC, SWITCH, N, X, F, D, INCFD, WK, NWK, IERR)
!C
!C   Parameters:
!C
!C     IC -- (input) integer array of length 2 specifying desired
!C           boundary conditions:
!C           IC(1) = IBEG, desired condition at beginning of data.
!C           IC(2) = IEND, desired condition at end of data.
!C
!C           IBEG = 0  for the default boundary condition (the same as
!C                     used by DPCHIM).
!C           If IBEG.NE.0, then its sign indicates whether the boundary
!C                     derivative is to be adjusted, if necessary, to be
!C                     compatible with monotonicity:
!C              IBEG.GT.0  if no adjustment is to be performed.
!C              IBEG.LT.0  if the derivative is to be adjusted for
!C                     monotonicity.
!C
!C           Allowable values for the magnitude of IBEG are:
!C           IBEG = 1  if first derivative at X(1) is given in VC(1).
!C           IBEG = 2  if second derivative at X(1) is given in VC(1).
!C           IBEG = 3  to use the 3-point difference formula for D(1).
!C                     (Reverts to the default b.c. if N.LT.3 .)
!C           IBEG = 4  to use the 4-point difference formula for D(1).
!C                     (Reverts to the default b.c. if N.LT.4 .)
!C           IBEG = 5  to set D(1) so that the second derivative is con-
!C              tinuous at X(2). (Reverts to the default b.c. if N.LT.4.)
!C              This option is somewhat analogous to the "not a knot"
!C              boundary condition provided by DPCHSP.
!C
!C          NOTES (IBEG):
!C           1. An error return is taken if ABS(IBEG).GT.5 .
!C           2. Only in case  IBEG.LE.0  is it guaranteed that the
!C              interpolant will be monotonic in the first interval.
!C              If the returned value of D(1) lies between zero and
!C              3*SLOPE(1), the interpolant will be monotonic.  This
!C              is **NOT** checked if IBEG.GT.0 .
!C           3. If IBEG.LT.0 and D(1) had to be changed to achieve mono-
!C              tonicity, a warning error is returned.
!C
!C           IEND may take on the same values as IBEG, but applied to
!C           derivative at X(N).  In case IEND = 1 or 2, the value is
!C           given in VC(2).
!C
!C          NOTES (IEND):
!C           1. An error return is taken if ABS(IEND).GT.5 .
!C           2. Only in case  IEND.LE.0  is it guaranteed that the
!C              interpolant will be monotonic in the last interval.
!C              If the returned value of D(1+(N-1)*INCFD) lies between
!C              zero and 3*SLOPE(N-1), the interpolant will be monotonic.
!C              This is **NOT** checked if IEND.GT.0 .
!C           3. If IEND.LT.0 and D(1+(N-1)*INCFD) had to be changed to
!C              achieve monotonicity, a warning error is returned.
!C
!C     VC -- (input) real(8)array of length 2 specifying desired boundary
!C           values, as indicated above.
!C           VC(1) need be set only if IC(1) = 1 or 2 .
!C           VC(2) need be set only if IC(2) = 1 or 2 .
!C
!C     SWITCH -- (input) indicates desired treatment of points where
!C           direction of monotonicity switches:
!C           Set SWITCH to zero if interpolant is required to be mono-
!C           tonic in each interval, regardless of monotonicity of data.
!C             NOTES:
!C              1. This will cause D to be set to zero at all switch
!C                 points, thus forcing extrema there.
!C              2. The result of using this option with the default boun-
!C                 dary conditions will be identical to using DPCHIM, but
!C                 will generally cost more compute time.
!C                 This option is provided only to facilitate comparison
!C                 of different switch and/or boundary conditions.
!C           Set SWITCH nonzero to use a formula based on the 3-point
!C              difference formula in the vicinity of switch points.
!C           If SWITCH is positive, the interpolant on each interval
!C              containing an extremum is controlled to not deviate from
!C              the data by more than SWITCH*DFLOC, where DFLOC is the
!C              maximum of the change of F on this interval and its two
!C              immediate neighbors.
!C           If SWITCH is negative, no such control is to be imposed.
!C
!C     N -- (input) number of data points.  (Error return if N.LT.2 .)
!C
!C     X -- (input) real(8)array of independent variable values.  The
!C           elements of X must be strictly increasing:
!C                X(I-1) .LT. X(I),  I = 2(1)N.
!C           (Error return if not.)
!C
!C     F -- (input) real(8)array of dependent variable values to be
!C           interpolated.  F(1+(I-1)*INCFD) is value corresponding to
!C           X(I).
!C
!C     D -- (output) real(8)array of derivative values at the data
!C           points.  These values will determine a monotone cubic
!C           Hermite function on each subinterval on which the data
!C           are monotonic, except possibly adjacent to switches in
!C           monotonicity. The value corresponding to X(I) is stored in
!C                D(1+(I-1)*INCFD),  I=1(1)N.
!C           No other entries in D are changed.
!C
!C     INCFD -- (input) increment between successive values in F and D.
!C           This argument is provided primarily for 2-D applications.
!C           (Error return if  INCFD.LT.1 .)
!C
!C     WK -- (scratch) real(8)array of working storage.  The user may
!C           wish to know that the returned values are:
!C              WK(I)     = H(I)     = X(I+1) - X(I) ;
!C              WK(N-1+I) = SLOPE(I) = (F(1,I+1) - F(1,I)) / H(I)
!C           for  I = 1(1)N-1.
!C
!C     NWK -- (input) length of work array.
!C           (Error return if  NWK.LT.2*(N-1) .)
!C
!C     IERR -- (output) error flag.
!C           Normal return:
!C              IERR = 0  (no errors).
!C           Warning errors:
!C              IERR = 1  if IBEG.LT.0 and D(1) had to be adjusted for
!C                        monotonicity.
!C              IERR = 2  if IEND.LT.0 and D(1+(N-1)*INCFD) had to be
!C                        adjusted for monotonicity.
!C              IERR = 3  if both of the above are true.
!C           "Recoverable" errors:
!C              IERR = -1  if N.LT.2 .
!C              IERR = -2  if INCFD.LT.1 .
!C              IERR = -3  if the X-array is not strictly increasing.
!C              IERR = -4  if ABS(IBEG).GT.5 .
!C              IERR = -5  if ABS(IEND).GT.5 .
!C              IERR = -6  if both of the above are true.
!C              IERR = -7  if NWK.LT.2*(N-1) .
!C             (The D-array has not been changed in any of these cases.)
!C               NOTE:  The above errors are checked in the order listed,
!C                   and following arguments have **NOT** been validated.

!C***DESCRIPTION
!C
!C          DPCHCE:  DPCHIC End Derivative Setter.
!C
!C    Called by DPCHIC to set end derivatives as requested by the user.
!C    It must be called after interior derivative values have been set.
!C                      -----
!C
!C    To facilitate two-dimensional applications, includes an increment
!C    between successive values of the D-array.

!C  Calling sequence:
!C
!C        PARAMETER  (INCFD = ...)
!C        INTEGER  IC(2), N, IERR
!C        DOUBLE PRECISION  VC(2), X(N), H(N), SLOPE(N), D(INCFD,N)
!C
!C        CALL  DPCHCE (IC, VC, N, X, H, SLOPE, D, INCFD, IERR)
!C
!C   Parameters:
!C
!C     IC -- (input) integer array of length 2 specifying desired
!C           boundary conditions:
!C           IC(1) = IBEG, desired condition at beginning of data.
!C           IC(2) = IEND, desired condition at end of data.
!C           ( see prologue to DPCHIC for details. )
!C
!C     VC -- (input) real(8)array of length 2 specifying desired boundary
!C           values.  VC(1) need be set only if IC(1) = 2 or 3 .
!C                    VC(2) need be set only if IC(2) = 2 or 3 .
!C
!C     N -- (input) number of data points.  (assumes N.GE.2)
!C
!C     X -- (input) real(8)array of independent variable values.  (the
!C           elements of X are assumed to be strictly increasing.)
!C
!C     H -- (input) real(8)array of interval lengths.
!C     SLOPE -- (input) real(8)array of data slopes.
!C           If the data are (X(I),Y(I)), I=1(1)N, then these inputs are:
!C                  H(I) =  X(I+1)-X(I),
!C              SLOPE(I) = (Y(I+1)-Y(I))/H(I),  I=1(1)N-1.
!C
!C     D -- (input) real(8)array of derivative values at the data points.
!C           The value corresponding to X(I) must be stored in
!C                D(1+(I-1)*INCFD),  I=1(1)N.
!C          (output) the value of D at X(1) and/or X(N) is changed, if
!C           necessary, to produce the requested boundary conditions.
!C           no other entries in D are changed.
!C
!C     INCFD -- (input) increment between successive values in D.
!C           This argument is provided primarily for 2-D applications.
!C
!C     IERR -- (output) error flag.
!C           Normal return:
!C              IERR = 0  (no errors).
!C           Warning errors:
!C              IERR = 1  if IBEG.LT.0 and D(1) had to be adjusted for
!C                        monotonicity.
!C              IERR = 2  if IEND.LT.0 and D(1+(N-1)*INCFD) had to be
!C                        adjusted for monotonicity.
!C              IERR = 3  if both of the above are true.

!C
!C  Programming notes:
!C     1. The function DPCHST(ARG1,ARG2)  is assumed to return zero if
!C        either argument is zero, +1 if they are of the same sign, and
!C        -1 if they are of opposite sign.
!C     2. One could reduce the number of arguments and amount of local
!C        storage, at the expense of reduced code clarity, by passing in
!C        the array WK (rather than splitting it into H and SLOPE) and
!C        increasing its length enough to incorporate STEMP and XTEMP.
!C     3. The two monotonicity checks only use the sufficient conditions.
!C        Thus, it is possible (but unlikely) for a boundary condition to
!C        be changed, even though the original interpolant was monotonic.
!C        (At least the result is a continuous function of the data.)

!C
!C     Called by  DPCHIC  to adjust the values of D in the vicinity of a

!C
!C   Parameters:
!C
!C     SWITCH -- (input) indicates the amount of control desired over
!C           local excursions from data.
!C
!C     N -- (input) number of data points.  (assumes N.GT.2 .)
!C
!C     H -- (input) real(8)array of interval lengths.
!C     SLOPE -- (input) real(8)array of data slopes.
!C           If the data are (X(I),Y(I)), I=1(1)N, then these inputs are:
!C                  H(I) =  X(I+1)-X(I),
!C              SLOPE(I) = (Y(I+1)-Y(I))/H(I),  I=1(1)N-1.
!C
!C     D -- (input) real(8)array of derivative values at the data points,
!C           as determined by DPCHCI.
!C          (output) derivatives in the vicinity of switches in direction
!C           of monotonicity may be adjusted to produce a more "visually
!C           pleasing" curve.
!C           The value corresponding to X(I) is stored in
!C                D(1+(I-1)*INCFD),  I=1(1)N.
!C           No other entries in D are changed.
!C
!C     INCFD -- (input) increment between successive values in D.
!C           This argument is provided primarily for 2-D applications.
!C
!C     IERR -- (output) error flag.  should be zero.
!C           If negative, trouble in DPCHSW.  (should never happen.)

!C   820218  DATE WRITTEN
!C   820617  Redesigned to (1) fix  problem with lack of continuity
!C           approaching a flat-topped peak (2) be cleaner and
!C           easier to verify.
!C           Eliminated subroutines PCHSA and PCHSX in the process.
!C   820622  1. Limited fact to not exceed one, so computed D is a
!C             convex combination of DPCHCI value and DPCHSD value.

!C***DESCRIPTION
!C
!C          DPCHCI:  DPCHIC Initial Derivative Setter.
!C
!C    Called by DPCHIC to set derivatives needed to determine a monotone
!C    piecewise cubic Hermite interpolant to the data.
!C
!C    Default boundary conditions are provided which are compatible
!C    with monotonicity.  If the data are only piecewise monotonic, the
!C    interpolant will have an extremum at each point where monotonicity
!C    switches direction.
!C
!C    To facilitate two-dimensional applications, includes an increment
!C    between successive values of the D-array.
!C
!C    The resulting piecewise cubic Hermite function should be identical
!C    (within roundoff error) to that produced by DPCHIM.

!C        DOUBLE PRECISION  H(N), SLOPE(N), D(INCFD,N)
!C
!C        CALL  DPCHCI (N, H, SLOPE, D, INCFD)
!C
!C   Parameters:
!C
!C     N -- (input) number of data points.
!C           If N=2, simply does linear interpolation.
!C
!C     H -- (input) real(8)array of interval lengths.
!C     SLOPE -- (input) real(8)array of data slopes.
!C           If the data are (X(I),Y(I)), I=1(1)N, then these inputs are:
!C                  H(I) =  X(I+1)-X(I),
!C              SLOPE(I) = (Y(I+1)-Y(I))/H(I),  I=1(1)N-1.
!C
!C     D -- (output) real(8)array of derivative values at data points.
!C           If the data are monotonic, these values will determine a
!C           a monotone cubic Hermite function.
!C           The value corresponding to X(I) is stored in
!C                D(1+(I-1)*INCFD),  I=1(1)N.
!C           No other entries in D are changed.
!C
!C     INCFD -- (input) increment between successive values in D.
!C           This argument is provided primarily for 2-D applications.

!C***DESCRIPTION
!C
!C         DPCHSW:  DPCHCS Switch Excursion Limiter.
!C
!C     Called by  DPCHCS  to adjust D1 and D2 if necessary to insure that
!C     the extremum on this interval is not further than DFMAX from the
!C     extreme data value.
!C

!C
!C  Calling sequence:
!C
!C        INTEGER  IEXTRM, IERR
!C        DOUBLE PRECISION  DFMAX, D1, D2, H, SLOPE
!C
!C        CALL  DPCHSW (DFMAX, IEXTRM, D1, D2, H, SLOPE, IERR)
!C
!C   Parameters:
!C
!C     DFMAX -- (input) maximum allowed difference between F(IEXTRM) and
!C           the cubic determined by derivative values D1,D2.  (assumes
!C           DFMAX.GT.0.)
!C
!C     IEXTRM -- (input) index of the extreme data value.  (assumes
!C           IEXTRM = 1 or 2 .  Any value .NE.1 is treated as 2.)
!C
!C     D1,D2 -- (input) derivative values at the ends of the interval.
!C           (Assumes D1*D2 .LE. 0.)
!C          (output) may be modified if necessary to meet the restriction
!C           imposed by DFMAX.
!C
!C     H -- (input) interval length.  (Assumes  H.GT.0.)
!C
!C     SLOPE -- (input) data slope on the interval.
!C
!C     IERR -- (output) error flag.  should be zero.
!C           If IERR=-1, assumption on D1 and D2 is not satisfied.
!C           If IERR=-2, quadratic equation locating extremum has
!C                       negative discriminant (should never occur).
